  Starting from the type tree defined in the text, define a
  function contents that collects all values in a tree in a list,
  in any order, without removing duplicates. Then define a function sum_tree
  that sums up all values in a tree of natural numbers and
  prove sum_tree t = sum_list (contents t) (where sum_list is predefined).
